[<kbd>Quickstart</kbd> *Best for Hiring Managers setting up and maintaining interview loops*]

# Hiring Engineers and Engineering Managers

There are many different kinds of loops and approaches to interviewing across the industry, but all organizations are trying to do the same thing: figure out whether or not a candidate is a solid fit for their role. Tailoring the loop to your team's needs is great if your organization gives you that flexibility, but having a standard loop to improve consistency and reduce bias is more important for larger organizations.

This guide contains some broader principles that will help when creating new loops or improving existing loops. This is addressed to the hiring manager, so "you" refers to the manager or employee responsible for defining the interviews and the overall process.

## tl;dr;

If you're looking for a quick template for IC loops, try this:
* One phone screen to assess base coding ability
* One on-site coding interview focused on live coding and debugging
* One on-site problem solving interview focused on technical challenges relevant for the role
* One on-site architecture interview focused on designing high-level systems and components
* One interview with an experienced team member focused on fit

## Individual Contributor Loops

The most important question to ask when making a loop is, what signals do you need? Most "standard" loops consist of basic coding, algorithm, and architecture interviews because they assess skills that are the most commonly (and easily) applied across a variety of engineering roles. Although these are effective, your needs might vary from what most major tech companies are looing for. Do you have a very specific tech stack that requires expertise? Does your team work as consultants with a variety of different customer integrations? Is the company in a state where the technical roadmap is set for the next two years and you just need engineers to crank out code?

There are many different signals you could try to focus on, but here are some suggestions:
* Do you need someone who is an expert with a specific tech stack or can you afford to find a generalist who can pick up new technology quickly?
* How much do you expect your new hire to contribute to long-term architecture and stability of your systems?
* Do you have opportunity for someone who needs some coaching and support or do you need someone a bit more independent? (see <a href="drafts/requests.md">Guide to Engineering Levels</a>)
* How important is collaboration and communication for your team?
