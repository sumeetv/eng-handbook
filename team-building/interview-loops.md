[<kbd>Quickstart</kbd> *Best for Hiring Managers setting up and maintaining interview loops*]

# Hiring Engineers and Engineering Managers

Regardless of role, level, or company, there are always two overarching goals to every interview loop:

1. Getting the right signal to know if the candidate is a good fit for the role
2. Making sure candidates have a good opinion of the company regardless of the outcome

Depending on your company's needs, you might have to work in a pretty rigid framework due to standardizing loops across a company with many open roles looking for generals. On the other hand, you might have total freedom to tailor the loop to each individual team's needs, which can introduce other issues around bias and consistency.

This guide contains some broader principles that will help when creating new loops or updating existing loops. This is addressed to the hiring manager, so "you" refers to the manager or employee responsible for defining the interviews and the overall process.

## tl;dr;

If you're looking for a quick template for IC loops, try this:
* One phone screen to assess base coding ability
* One on-site coding interview focused on live coding and debugging
* One on-site problem solving interview focused on technical challenges relevant for the role
* One on-site architecture interview focused on designing high-level systems and components
* One interview with an experienced team member focused on fit
* One 15-minute break in the middle of the day independent of lunch or any social interactions

## Individual Contributor Loops

### Making your own loop from scratch

The most important question to ask when making a loop is, what signals do you need? Most "standard" loops consist of basic coding, algorithm, and architecture interviews because they assess skills that are the most commonly (and easily) applied across a variety of engineering roles. Although these are effective, your needs might vary from what most major tech companies are looing for. Do you have a very specific tech stack that requires expertise? Does your team work as consultants with a variety of different customer integrations? Is the company in a state where the technical roadmap is set for the next two years and you just need engineers to crank out code?

There are many different signals you could try to focus on, but here are some suggestions:
* Do you need someone who is an expert with a specific tech stack or can you afford to find a generalist who can pick up new technology quickly?
* How much do you expect your new hire to contribute to long-term architecture and stability of your systems?
* Do you have opportunity for someone who needs some coaching and support or do you need someone a bit more independent? (see <a href="drafts/requests.md">Guide to Engineering Levels</a>)

#### "Fit"

Fit is typically the most nebulous and dangerous signal to try and get in a loop. It can be easy to look for people who are like other people on the team, but this can lead to some unhealthy team dynamics and culture in the long run. Having an experienced interviewer or team member handle this part of the loop can help, but it can be helpful to outline what strengths your team needs versus what red flags would be concerning. Anything that doesn't explicitly fall into either category should be dismissed to avoid bias.

Potential signal for fit:

* Ability to deal with failure
* Tolerance for "crunch" and work long hours
* Communication style with coworkers of varying tenure / experience

### Working With an Existing Framework

At larger companies, you might have standard interviews already defined. This can take a lot of pressure off of you as the manager, but there are still things you can do to tweak and improve your loop for the best candidate experience.

* How important is collaboration and communication for your team?
